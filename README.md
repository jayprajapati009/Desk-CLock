# Desk-Clock

## Problem:
When a person undergoes a LASIK Surgery the layers of his eyes take a long time to heal. If the healing of these layers does not happen properly then, some amount of refractive error remains in that eyes forever. Such things happen to the persons who work for a  long time on screens. There is a rule by medical science that every person need to follow a 20-20-20 rule while working or using on Screen, i.e., After every 20 Minutes take a break of 20 Seconds to blink the eyes and look as far as possible this helps the tissue to maintain your vision without any refractive errors. If you follow this 20-20-20-rule in your routine, our eyes will be healthy.
As a Human, we have the tendency to forget such things that to a thing which is to be performed every 20 minutes while working. So in such cases, you need some sort of reminder.

## My  Solution:
As a solution to the above-mentioned problem, I have made an IoT Based Desk Clock. The desk clock features are as follows,
- It is enabled with a timer of 20 Minutes (With a counter for 20 Mins in MM:SS format) with a break of 20 Seconds.
- After 20 Minutes, there is a buzzing alarm reminding Blinking Eyes.
- There is a counter of 20 Seconds in MM:SS format during the break with a message displaying "Blink Your Eyes".
- It Shows the Time(12 Hours Format), Day, and Date.
