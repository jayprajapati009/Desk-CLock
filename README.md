## Problem:
When a person udergoes a LASIK Surgery the layers of his eyes takes a long time to heal. If the healing of these layers doesnot happen properly then, the some amount of refractive error reamins in that eyes forever. Such things happen to the persons who work for a  long time on screens. There is a rule by medical science that every person need to follow a 20-20-20 rule while working or using on Screen, i.e., After every 20 Minutes take a break of 20 Seconds to blink the eyes and look as far as possible this helps the tissue to maintain your vision without any refractive errors. If you follow this 20-20-20-rule in your routine, our eyes will be healthy.
